I've tried to setup the godot project and connect it with the debugger of VsCode. At the moment it does not look like that this will work in the near future. Because of that I'm thinking about what I can do instead and came up with the idea to implement some unit-test. I think the burger blueprint generator will be an excellent playground for that.
